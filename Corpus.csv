The Biden administration on Friday announced it will issue a rule to protect an Obama-era deportation relief program from a court challenge that threatens the legal protections of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

Citing instructions in an executive order signed by President Biden on Inauguration Day, Homeland Security Secretary said his department will publish a proposed rule to ""preserve and fortify"" the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.

U.S. District Court Judge is set to issue a ruling in a lawsuit filed by Texas' Republican attorney general, who is seeking to have the Obama-era program declared unlawful and gradually terminated.

Hanen, who has previously said he believes DACA is likely unlawful, was notified of the expected regulation earlier Friday. Last week, Hanen scheduled a hearing on the case for this Tuesday, citing a bill passed by the Democratic-led House that would place DACA recipients and other immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors on a pathway to U.S. citizenship.

""We are taking action to preserve and fortify DACA,"" Mayorkas said in a statement. ""This is in keeping with the President's memorandum. It is an important step, but only the passage of legislation can give full protection and a path to citizenship to the Dreamers who know the U.S. as their home.""

More than 640,000 immigrants known as ""Dreamers"" are currently enrolled in the DACA program, which shields them from deportation and allows them to work legally in the U.S. DACA was created in 2012 during the Obama administration through a department memo issued by then-DHS secretary.

In the case overseen by Hanen, Texas Attorney Ken Paxton has argued that DACA is unlawful, in part because the Obama administration did not implement the program through the federal government's rule-making process or allow the public to comment on the policy. 

Though the specific contents of the rule announced remain unknown, the regulation likely represents the Biden administration's attempt to undermine Texas' legal argument. 

DACA recipients and their allies have garnered significant legal victories in recent years, convincing multiple federal judges and the Supreme Court to rule that the Trump administration violated federal administrative law when it moved to end the Obama-era initiative in September 2017.

It is estimated that at least 300,000 immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission qualify for DACA status.

The prerequisites for DACA eligibility include having no serious criminal convictions, arriving in the U.S before the age 16, living in the country since at least 2007 and earning an American high school diploma, a GED or serving honorably in the military. DACA does not allow its beneficiaries to adjust their status and obtain lawful permanent residency.

The American Dream and Promise Act passed by the Democratic-controlled House with some Republican support last week would allow DACA beneficiaries and other undocumented immigrants brought to the country before age 18 to apply for a 10-year period of conditional permanent residence if they satisfy several requirements.

Mr. Biden has said he would sign the proposal into law, but it is unclear whether the bill, which would also legalize hundreds of thousands of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status, can muster enough support in the evenly-divided Senate, where most legislation requires 60 votes to pass."
1,AK_Doc2_Biden-Rescind-Immigration-Policy.docx,"President Biden, the Clock Is Ticking to Rescind a Trump Immigration Policy

By Jorge Ramos

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/opinion/international-world/biden-migration-reform.html

One of the Trump administration’s most unfair and arbitrary deportation policies, known as Title 42, is still being applied today along the southern border, although the Biden administration has begun to admit children into the country. Invoked as a health measure to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in holding facilities, the order allows border agents to turn away migrants without allowing them a chance to apply for asylum. According to reporting in The New York Times, almost 550,000 people have been expelled by the Department of Homeland Security during this fiscal year.

Enforcement of Title 42 rules should therefore end immediately, and border crossings between the United States and Mexico should return to normal status with normal rules for asylum applications. It would also help if the United States were to donate millions of vaccines to Mexican border communities.

Mr. Biden’s $4 billion investment plan for Central America, designed to combat northbound migration at its roots, will require several years before it yields results. In the meantime, we urgently need a humane system to deal with Central Americans who are fleeing conditions of extreme poverty, violence and gang intimidation.

And, just as urgent, we must legalize the residential status of millions of undocumented migrants, some of whom have been living in the United States for decades. This is a promise that has gone unfulfilled since amnesty was granted during the Reagan administration in 1986, when the Immigration Reform and Control Act legalized the status of most immigrants who had arrived in the United States before 1982.: Republicans say they are unwilling to consider any legalization proposal until the southern border is secure. Yet it is almost impossible to entirely secure a shared border that is more than 1,900 miles long and where the U.S. Border Patrol detained more than 178,000 people attempting illegal entry in April alone.

I’m sure that if Congress were to send him an immigration bill legalizing the presence of more than 10 million undocumented residents, he would sign it immediately.



President Barack Obama failed to introduce his immigration reform proposal in 2009, when his party controlled both chambers of Congress and the country was facing a severe financial crisis; later, he didn’t have enough votes to pass it. President Biden shouldn’t take these kinds of risks. He should hurry.

the issue is important to him, Mr. Biden recently met with a group of “Dreamers” at the White House. The meeting was extraordinary in and of itself. These young people were brought into the United States by their parents illegally, and are exempted from deportation through the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program. 

Democrats still lack the votes to overturn the current Senate rules, which effectively require proponents of most bills to muster 60-vote supermajorities to advance them. The only way out is to end the minority party’s power to stall legislation and pass very concrete laws for the benefit of Dreamers and migrant farm workers. Both issues are politically aggressive and would face huge Republican opposition. But it’s about time we made radical decisions to protect the lives of millions of immigrants."
2,Earnshaw1_Paris-Climate-Agreement.docx,"U.S. Rejoins Paris Climate Agreement

President Biden told leaders of the Group of 7 nations that climate change was a priority for his administration as the United States formally rejoined the Paris climate agreement on Friday.

We can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change. This is a global existential crisis. And we’ll all suffer, we’ll all suffer the consequences if we fail. We have to rapidly accelerate our commitments to aggressively curb our emissions and to hold one another accountable for meeting our goals and increasing our ambitions. That’s why, as president, I immediately rejoined the Paris agreement. And as of today, the United States is officially, once again, a party to the Paris agreement, which we helped put together. On Earth Day, I will host a Leaders Summit to help drive a more ambitious actions among the top emitters, including domestic climate action here in the United States. I am grateful, I’m grateful for Europe’s continued leadership on climate issues over the last four years. Together, we need to invest in the technological innovations that are going to power our clean energy futures and enable us to build clean energy solutions to global markets.

The United States on Friday formally rejoined the Paris climate agreement, the international accord designed to avert catastrophic global warming.

President Biden has said tackling the climate crisis is among his highest priorities and he signed an executive order recommitting the United States to the accord only hours after he was sworn into office last month.

“We can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change,” Mr. Biden said on Friday. “This is a global, existential crisis. And we’ll all suffer the consequences if we fail.”

It was a sharp repudiation of the Trump administration, which had pulled the country out of the pact and seemed eager to undercut regulations aimed at protecting the environment.

With some 189 countries joining the pact in 2016, it had broad international support and Mr. Biden’s move to rejoin the effort was welcomed by foreign leaders.

“Welcome back to the Paris Agreement!” Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, said in a Twitter message at the time.

The galvanizing idea of the Paris climate accord is that only global solidarity and collective action can prevent the ravages of climate change: hotter temperatures, rising sea levels, more powerful storms, or droughts leading to food shortages.

President Biden has announced a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to increase the use of clean energies in transportation, electricity and building sectors, while rapidly moving away from coal, oil and gas. He has set a goal of eliminating fossil fuel emissions from electricity generation by 2035 and has vowed to put the entire United States economy on track to become carbon neutral by midcentury."
3,Earnshaw2_Tech-Antitrust.docx,"Biden Is Assembling a Big Tech Antitrust All-Star Team

Appointing Lina Khan to the FTC would add an anti-monopoly crusader to a crucial position—as does Tim Wu’s installment at the National Economic Council.

Should she be appointed to the FTC, Lina Khan will have plenty of tools at her disposal to enforce her thoroughly modern vision of antitrust regulation.PHOTOGRAPH: LEXEY SWALL/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX



DURING THE DEMOCRATIC presidential primary, several candidates made antitrust enforcement against Big Tech part of their campaign pitch. Joe Biden was not one of them. When he won the nomination, and ultimately the presidency, Silicon Valley executives probably felt as if they had dodged a bullet. If so, they appear to have been mistaken.

On Tuesday morning, Politico reported that Biden plans to nominate the legal academic Lina Khan to an open seat on the Federal Trade Commission, one of the agencies with the most power to enforce antitrust laws. Khan is at the vanguard of the Big Tech antitrust movement. In January 2017, while still a student at Yale Law School, she became an overnight academic celebrity with the publication of a paper titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” which both took aim at Amazon’s anticompetitive behavior and delivered a powerful critique of the antitrust establishment. Last year, as a staffer on the House antitrust subcommittee, she was a key figure behind the landmark investigation into Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. Now, Khan is on the verge of becoming part of a new antitrust establishment. (Disclosure: Khan and I went to law school together and have remained friendly. On the other hand, she didn’t reply to my request for comment.)

Khan would be the second high-profile critic of Big Tech recruited to the administration in just the past few days. Last week, Biden named Tim Wu to the National Economic Council as a special assistant for technology and competition policy. Wu, who like Khan is a law professor at Columbia, is best known for coining the term “net neutrality.” In his 2010 book The Master Switch, at a time when very few people were putting “tech” and “antitrust” in the same sentence, he warned about the tendency for new communication technologies to monopolize. More recently he has emerged as one of the most sophisticated critics of the attention-driven business models of companies like Facebook and Google. Khan and Wu are the kind of people who would have likely staffed an Elizabeth Warren administration. The fact that Biden is bringing them on board is the strongest sign yet that his administration could have a much more critical eye toward tech and antitrust than many people expected."
4,Earnshaw3_Nepa-Environmental-Law.docx,"President Biden made clear his intention to rectify and improve the implementation of NEPA when, on his first day in office, he signed an executive order directing the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to review the Trump-era NEPA regulations and consider suspending, revising, or rescinding them. This action will set into motion a multiyear process to fortify the federal approach to project review, and it raises the question of what must come next.

The history of NEPA—and how its implementation was dismantled under the Trump administration

Enacted by Congress in 1970, NEPA is often characterized as the bedrock of environmental law. The statute functions as a critical climate action and environmental justice tool by requiring agencies to consider the environmental and public health impacts of proposed federal actions. The real teeth of NEPA come from its set of implementing regulations, first issued by the CEQ in 1978. These implementing regulations detail how federal agencies must conduct their environmental reviews and provide open comment periods to members of the public who stand to be affected by the proposed federal action. In this way, NEPA also constitutes the bedrock of community empowerment within federal decision-making—at least, it used to.

Recommendations for other actions the Biden administration should take on NEPA

To ensure President Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan moves as quickly as possible with the greatest environmental benefit, the new administration must harness the ambition and momentum of his day-one executive order to strengthen NEPA implementation.

Specifically, the CEQ should rescind and replace the Trump administration’s NEPA regulations. Conducting a new rulemaking process will—and should—take time. The new NEPA regulations must be thoughtfully designed to better support environmental justice, encourage public participation, protect ecological systems, and combat climate change. They will need to be the product of early and in-depth engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders, from community advocates to industry players.

But the health and welfare of the American people cannot afford to wait. In the interim, the CEQ must take critical steps to enable federal agencies and the country at large to start moving forward.

Stop the implementation of Trump-era NEPA regulations

In response to President Biden’s day-one executive order, the CEQ should issue corresponding guidance to federal agencies that provides greater certainty through a proposed timeline for rewriting the regulations. The CEQ should also direct agencies to do the following:

Stop the process of writing new implementing procedures for the Trump-era NEPA regulations. The Trump administration’s NEPA regulations require federal agencies to develop implementing procedures by September 2021. If finalized, these implementing procedures would carry more weight than the Trump-era NEPA regulations themselves. For example, the rule change that the U.S. Forest Service made to its implementing procedures in November 2020 will allow logging projects to bypass the NEPA environmental review process on nearly 200 million acres of national forest land."
5,EHC_Doc1_Topline-Russian-Cyberattack.docx,"TOPLINE A Russian criminal group is probably responsible for a disruptive new cyberattack on the world’s largest meat processing company, the White House claimed Tuesday, the latest in a string of hacks blamed on either the Russian government or lone criminals based in the country.



TIMELINE

May 2021 Meat processor JBS revealed Monday its IT systems were hacked, in what White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre characterized as a ransomware attack — a strategy in which hackers demand payment — likely perpetrated by Russian criminals.



May 2021 A group ostensibly tied to Russia’s intelligence service gained access to the U.S. Agency for International Development’s email system and tried to send virus-laden phishing emails to hundreds of USAID-linked organizations, Microsoft said Thursday.



May 2021 A pipeline carrying 45% of the East Coast’s gasoline was shut down due to an attack blamed on hacking collective DarkSide, prompting Colonial Pipeline to pay out $4.4 million in ransom, but although the perpetrators appear to be based in Russia, President Joe Biden said there’s no evidence the Russian government is connected.



December 2020 In one of the worst cyberattacks in world history, hackers breached several U.S. government agencies and companies last year by exploiting software made by SolarWinds, an effort U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed on Russian spies.



October 2020 Russian government-sponsored hackers appeared to target multiple state and local government networks, successfully stealing data from two unnamed targets, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security said.



October 2020 U.S. hospitals were threatened by a spate of ransomware attacks, the FBI and DHS said, using malicious software some cybersecurity experts and government agencies say is often deployed by Russian-speaking criminal gangs.





CONTRA

The Russian government has consistently denied any involvement in recent hacking campaigns, telling Forbes in a December statement these attacks run counter to “the principals of the Russian foreign policy, national interests and our understanding of interstate relations.” Most recently, the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., called allegations Russia was behind the JBS hack “groundless.”



KEY BACKGROUND

Even though some recent cyberattacks have been blamed on Russian criminal gangs rather than government actors, some cybersecurity experts and government officials think Russian authorities quietly tolerate these private hackers. Dr. Susan Landau, a cybersecurity professor at Tufts University’s School of Engineering and Fletcher School, thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin likely allows criminal hacking gangs to operate in his country — and sometimes implicitly collaborates with them — because it ""fits with his foreign policy objectives, and it doesn't cost him anything.” Cyberattacks on corporate targets can assert Russia’s power globally and create insecurity in the United States, and most recent hacks have been small enough to avoid drawing severe retaliation from the United States. Plus, by outsourcing this activity to criminals, the Russian government gains what Landau calls “implausible deniability.”





TANGENT

For years, Russia has been accused of leading or otherwise endorsing brutal hacking campaigns. Russia was tied to an infamous hack of the Democratic National Committee’s email server in 2016, part of a wider apparent effort to sway the results of the 2016 presidential election. And Russian intelligence officers were accused last year of orchestrating a massive 2017 cyberattack that caused billions of dollars in damage to businesses worldwide. While countries have conducted cyber-espionage on each other for years, Landau says Russia’s interest in sophisticated offensive attacks seemed to begin in 2015, when hackers linked to Russia managed to shut down parts of Ukraine’s power grid."
6,EHC_Doc2_Microsoft-Russian-Cyberattack.docx,"Microsoft says another wave of Russian cyber-attacks has targeted government agencies and human rights groups in 24 countries, most in the US.



It said about 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organisations had been attacked this week.



The group responsible was the same one that carried out last year's SolarWinds attacks, which Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is accused of orchestrating, Microsoft said.



Russia has denied both cyber-attacks.



The Kremlin on Friday said it had no knowledge of the latest hacks, and called on the US tech giant to answer further questions, including how it was linked to Russia.



How were the new cyber-attacks mounted?

In a blog post published late on Thursday, Microsoft said the new attacks targeted government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of ""intelligence gathering efforts"".



It said at least a quarter of the organisations targeted were involved in international development, humanitarian and human rights work.



While most were in the US, targeted victims spanned at least 24 countries.



According to Microsoft, Nobelium, a group originating in Russia, launched this week's attacks by gaining access to an email marketing account used by the US federal government's aid agency, USAID.



Hackers then sent emails that looked authentic but included a link which, when clicked, inserted a malicious file enabling the stealing of data and infecting other computers on a network.



A spokesperson for the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) told CBS News authorities were aware of the attack and were trying ""to better understand the extent of the compromise and assist potential victims"".



Microsoft said many of the attacks targeting its customers were blocked automatically. It was not immediately clear how many of the attempts led to successful intrusions.



Last year, hackers used US company SolarWinds' Orion platform to target US government departments, about 100 private companies and small numbers of UK organisations. At the end, nearly 18,000 customers installed the malicious software.



The SVR was blamed by the UK and US for the hack. It has denied involvement.



It was only last month that Washington took aim at Russia's hackers - calling out the SVR, it's foreign intelligence agency, for SolarWinds and issuing sanctions for its activity. And yet Moscow shows no sign of being deterred.



The head of the SVR told the BBC it had nothing to do with that last campaign, even suggesting America could have hacked itself. And now Microsoft has discovered a new campaign by the same group.



It may not be as sophisticated or stealthy as the last but it's very brazenness will be what concerns Washington.



It will further raise the question - with a summit between US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a few weeks - about whether anything can be done to contain this threat."
7,HNN_Doc1_Housing-Crisis.docx,"Housing crisis poses crucial test for Biden administration’s economic plans

In the span of 48 hours last week, the administration launched an aggressive push to reshape national housing policy

The Biden administration mounted an aggressive push reshaping national housing policy in a span of 48 hours this past week, replacing a key regulator and pushing a flurry of other changes to try to address growing concerns within and outside the White House about a housing crisis for millions of renters and vulnerable Americans.



On Wednesday, the White House named an acting director of the powerful Federal Housing Finance Agency, Sandra L. Thompson, who called out the lack of affordable housing and access to credit for many communities of color. The White House appointed her hours after tossing a Trump appointee.



Then on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended its eviction moratorium by one month. The Biden administration also announced initiatives to quicken the disbursal of rental relief and encourage local governments and courts to prevent evictions. As part of the effort, the White House will convene a summit this Wednesday for “immediate eviction prevention plans” to prevent an “eviction crisis.”



Housing has emerged as one of the most unequal and consequential parts of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Low interest rates, cheap mortgages and bidding wars are fueling a housing boom for wealthier Americans and making homeownership out of reach for many first-time buyers. Meanwhile, housing is a top expense and worry for millions of renters and unemployed workers, and advocates fear a wave of homelessness once the CDC’s final moratorium lifts July 31.



It remains to be seen whether this bucket of housing policy shifts develops into a clear road map for how President Biden plans to handle one of the largest parts of the economy. Housing is an area that Democrats have traditionally tried to backstop with government support to make it more accessible for more people.



“There isn’t anything that has changed in the intensity with which we’re working,” said Erika Poethig, special assistant to the president for housing and urban policy at the White House’s Domestic Policy Council. “I do think the expectation around the end of the moratorium, and the consequence of that, have raised public awareness to the broader housing affordability challenges, and the consequences to losing one’s shelter and housing and how devastating that is.”



While the Biden administration has focused extraordinary effort on passing the stimulus package, overhauling the tax code and ushering in major infrastructure investments, less public attention has been devoted to housing policy. However, some experts say challenges — for renters, homeowners and the homeless — are fast approaching.



Though Congress has allocated roughly $46 billion for emergency rental aid through pandemic-era aid packages, much of that money hasn’t reached tenants. On Thursday, the White House and Treasury Department released new guidance to help streamline application processes, calling for an “all hands-on-deck effort,” which is partly why the White House’s housing summit on Wednesday will bring together 50 cities to discuss plans for preventing evictions."
8,HNN_Doc2_America-Housing-Mess.docx,"America Has a Housing Mess, and President Biden Wants to Fix It

U.S. housing policy is practically geologic in form. Since the 1930s, the federal government has rolled out layer upon layer of programs and incentives to help the poor, the middle class, veterans, and others afford homes. What we have today is an accretion of policies and bureaucracy that’s complex and inadequate for today’s needs. “It’s like sedimentary rock,” says Chris Herbert, the managing director of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. “There’s never really been a time when we sat down and said, ‘Let’s think about a coherent U.S. housing policy.’”

President Joe Biden wants to do better. With a possible eviction crisis looming and home prices spiraling further out of reach for many buyers, his administration is pushing for the biggest federal housing investment in decades—one that’s also designed to advance goals on climate and racial equity. This includes the more than $300 billion his administration has proposed to “build and modernize” housing as part of its sprawling infrastructure package, as well as a raft of social spending that will increase the amount of money Americans have to keep roofs over their heads. All this would come on top of the more than $50 billion in emergency funds Congress has allocated to help households that missed rent and mortgage payments during the pandemic.

The flood of money comes after decades in which federal spending on housing assistance receded. That pullback, as well as years of underbuilding, contributed to an acute affordable housing shortage going into the pandemic. Almost 11 million households spent more than half their income on rent in 2018, a level of financial stress that frequently tipped people into crisis. Here’s one mind-boggling number: On a single night in January 2020, more than 580,000 individuals were homeless in the U.S., according to a once-a-year count organized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Covid-19 has only exacerbated the inequities built into the system. Black and Hispanic households have lost jobs at higher rates than White families and are more likely to be behind on rent or mortgage payments. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s easy monetary policy sent mortgage rates to historic lows, allowing the well-heeled to refinance and buy second properties, while many first-time buyers are finding themselves shut out of the booming market. “If you don’t have excellent credit, if you don’t have a really high and competitive down payment, and if you don’t have the ability to go over ask, good luck,” says Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda, a housing data and consulting firm.

The emergency rental assistance Congress authorized this year and last, as well as policies such as the Centers for Disease Control’s eviction moratorium, are meant to prevent people from falling further and compounding their hardship. “One of the gaps we inherited that we are now forced to take on is the lack of a widespread structure to help Americans avoid unnecessary and potentially devastating evictions,” says Gene Sperling, a senior advisor to the president overseeing the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package passed in March. “We are racing to close that gap.”"

Evolution Of The Biotech IPO Markets From Busted To Booming



since 2013, it’s almost hard to remember how painful the equity capital markets were back in the day.



When I began my career in venture capital in 2004, the IPO markets were just opening up after the fallout from the bursting of the tech and genomics twin bubbles in 2001. Great companies like Atlas-backed Alnylam and Momenta were going public. Sixteen years later those two are a $15B commercial-stage biotech and a recent $6.5B acquisition by J&J, respectively – very successful biotechs by any measure. But most folks forget that their IPOs were really painful: both priced their offerings

~50% below the mid-point of the expected price range (here, here). This wasn’t an uncommon occurrence.



The IPO markets for most of the 2000s never warmed up much. Jazz Pharma, now a high flying $8B company, “took it on the chin” when it went public in 2007, nearly 30% below its target range. And in 2010, as things emerged from the Global Financial Crisis, the markets continued to be painful: for example, Anacor, acquired later for $5B by Pfizer, came in with an IPO that priced 70% below its target range; Pacira, now $2.5B, was 50% below its IPO mid-point; and Horizon, now $17B, priced its 2011 offering 20% below the range. And those are some of the winners.



Very much related to these challenging pricing discussions, valuations were also extremely constrained back then. Continuing a few of the examples above, Alnylam was preclinical and raised $35M at a $90M pre- money valuation, Momenta was in Phase 3 and raised $40M at $130M, Horizon was also in Phase 3 and raised $50M at $145M. Pre-money valuations during this period was often at or below the private investor cost basis in many IPOs.

In light of that rather bleak market context, in August 2009 I wrote a Nature Biotech article titled “Beyond the biotech IPO: a brave new world” which reflected on the “chronic deterioration in the viability of the public capital markets for the past decade.” It was indeed a challenging period.



During most of that decade, terms like over-subscribed, upsized and above-the-range were almost never used to describe biotech IPOs. Yet today, and to a large extent over the past 7 years, they are almost commonplace descriptors of new offerings. And valuations have also changed remarkably, particularly for early stage preclinical and Phase 1 stories.



Before digging into the reasons why, here’s a snapshot of some aggregate longitudinal data, courtesy of BMO Capital Markets, relating to how IPOs priced back then versus more recently:



Price discovery and IPO range setting has improved. From 2004 through spring 2012, more than two-thirds of IPOs priced below the range. In contrast, from mid-2012 through winter of 2020, two-thirds priced in the range or above. And since April 2020, 97% of the IPOs have priced in the range or above (all but one IPO). As the middle panel below shows, the median pricing relative to the mid-point of the expected IPO range was -25% in

pre-2012 period versus 0% in the post-2012 period (meaning in the latter period pricing typically happened at the mid-point). And since April 2020, the median pricing has actually been 7% above the mid-point ($1 above the midpoint, so commonly referred to as the top of the range).



Valuations have grown significantly. In the 2000s, the median post-money valuation was only $213M. That grew by 50% into the next decade to $323M, and more recently has exceeded

$600M. A bottom quartile IPO today is valued above a top quartile IPO in the 2000s, and often has early stage lead programs.







The obvious observation from the two left hand panels is that there was pervasive and significant mispricing, or mis-setting, of the expected valuation range in the IPO process of the 2004-2012 period versus the more recent periods. The setting of a price range is often more art than science, and requires gauging likely but not certain IPO-buying behaviors before deciding on the optimal valuation guardrails. But it appears that

eager bankers and aspiring biotechs got it wrong way more than they got it right in the 2000s.



And the clear takeaway from the right hand panel is that there’s significantly more demand for biotech IPOs today, and hence valuation appreciation.



So what changed in the IPO markets before/after 2012?



Two of the more well-appreciated responses involve (a) greater innovation and (b) the depth of the capital markets.



Biopharma has certainly been innovating and making new medicines that matter, and the markets have paid attention. As a sector we’ve taken the promises of the prior decades, like those around the Human Genome Project, and begun translating them into real medicines with impact.

Think about the advances in precision genetic medicine, engineered cell therapies, gene therapies, oligos, and many others. Further, COVID and our response to it have highlighted the role of science and biopharma in leading us out of this crisis. These innovations are real and will continue to deliver, and the markets have taken notice.



Further, the equity capital markets for biotech are indeed much deeper: there is a lot more capital in the healthcare equity markets across biotech specialists at mutual funds, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds. In particular, early in the period (2011-2015) several of the Big Biotechs drove significant outperformance of the NASDAQ Biotech Index, drawing more investors into the sector. Even though Big Biotech stock appreciation may have waned in the recent few years, many small and mid-cap biotech stocks have outperformed. All of this has deepened the

pool of capital churning in the sector in search of the next big one. The feast or famine nature to risk-on/risk-off capital flows, characteristic of the biotech sector’s first 30 years, seems to have abated.



The greater capital market interest in biopharma has created a virtuous cycle for the sector’s IPOs. In the past, companies often raised less ($30- 50M) at challenging valuations, could barely fund their R&D aspirations, and had to come back to the markets frequently. Given the small size of the raise, many large institutional investors couldn’t participate: their allocations would be far too small, and the illiquidity too constraining.

Today, a much more positive cycle exists: companies are raising more capital, which gives larger funds opportunities to deploy meaningful amounts, which increases demand and raises valuations. These higher valuations enable raising more capital without taking on dilution beyond the typical 20-25% IPO range. More capital means more robust R&D programs and broader pipelines. A positive cycle, for sure, and one that has enabled larger generalist pools of capital to participate in the sector.



These two dynamics – innovation and the deeper capital markets - are certainly valid, and explain a lot of the increase in valuations and interest in the space.



But they don’t explain the more efficient IPO pricing process in the recent period relative to the 2000s with regard to the expected valuation range.



Two major structural changes to the way IPOs get launched explain that change: the JOBS Act and the rise of the crossover round have unleashed a much more efficient price discovery mechanism in the post-2012 era.



Jumpstarting IPO efficiency

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act is the unsung hero of the biotech IPO boom since its passage in 2Q 2012. While largely discounted by the tech sector, the impact of the JOBS Act on biotech IPOs can’t be over-estimated in my opinion.



Candidly, I don’t think any of the financial reporting or cost reduction elements of the law, widely touted as really important at the time for “Emerging Growth Companies,”have actually had any meaningful impact, as supported by other research (here).



However, the two primary “de-risking” elements of the JOBS Act were profoundly important in biotech:



Confidential S1 filing. Before the JOBS Act, filing an S1 was instantly public and let the world know you were trying to IPO. For many aspiring biotechs without a good read from the public markets, this exposed them to huge “signaling” risk. S1s of less compelling stories could sit out there for months, sending the message to the public equity markets that the story was stale, mispriced, or uninteresting. Pulling an S1 was public too – revealing to the world that a company failed in their attempt to go public. These negatives carried large reputational risks. By allowing a confidential filing, biotechs could start the IPO process outside of the glaring eyes of the investment community. This also allowed them to be “ready” to flip their S1s public when the markets felt strong.



Testing-The-Waters (TTW). In the past, when an S1 was publicly on file, biotechs couldn’t meet with public investors outside of the formal IPO roadshow. This meant a lot of biotechs

were “going blind” on price discovery. They, and their bankers, had to make big guesses on price – and, as the data suggests, were often wrong. With the TTW process, while an S1 is confidentially on file, a biotech can meet with public investors to gauge interest.

Feedback from TTWs, often with 40-60 investors, provides hugely valuable input into the likely demand for a biotech’s upcoming offering and setting the right price range for an IPO.



Several factors contributed to the uncertainty in pricing before the JOBS Act. Given the complexity of the science behind most biotechs, especially early stage stories, and the lack of insight financial “modeling” provides in many of these, jumping into a biotech IPO as a public investor is difficult to do after one short initial meeting during the traditional road show. This is in part why crossover investing has appeal: the ability to do deep due diligence in a private round to establish conviction about an upcoming IPO.



Furthermore, bankers competing for underwriting business are often picked for telling a management team and Board that their company is worth a lot. Perhaps a lot more than it really is worth. And without the TTW process of price discovery, the initial price ranges for many IPOs of the pre- JOBS Act era were inflated as a consequence.



The JOBS Act helped resolve those inefficiencies in price-setting.



Crossover rounds: the quest for alpha.



Crossover rounds are name given to venture financings that are meant as the last private round before a public offering and involve investors that are typically public market players. These have become commonplace

today as biotechs chart their path to an IPO.



While nowhere near as frequent as in today’s market, crossover rounds did happen before. And they didn’t protect a company from mispricing their IPO ranges. Merrimack Pharma, priced just before the JOBS Act, had a marquee list of public investors in their last private rounds; unfortunately, MACK still priced below the range, 22% below the midpoint, in March 2012. Other 2010-2011 IPOs with public crossovers involved included Ironwood and Tengion, both of which came in below their targeted range. Much of the insider participation in many of these IPOs came from crossover investors, a characteristic that remains true today.



The “crossover phenom” in biotech really caught momentum in the 2012- 2014 period immediately following the JOBS Act. This was in large part driven by the quest for alpha. Just playing the market indices wasn’t enough. To outperform, there was a belief you needed the alpha of picking the beset new IPOs and catching the pop. Generally speaking, biotech IPOs were performing well in that period (see here for 2011-2012, 2013, 2014), but in order to get a meaningful allocation and a good cost basis, many public investors would seek out these private rounds to secure positions. And, as noted in a blog here in 2014, the involvement of the best blue-chip crossover investors appeared to be a good biomarker for an IPO’s quality: better valuations, bigger raises, and stronger aftermarket performance in the 2012-2014 period.



The positive dynamic of meaningful crossover involvement has continued since that period. Crossover rounds have multiple benefits. As noted above, they allow public investors a chance to thoroughly evaluate a

biotech before the TTW process. By doing so, they enable a biotech to build deeper relationships with important public buysiders. They also strengthen the balance sheet.



And they help guide the price of the IPO. Bankers love to use the “step-up” analysis to put guardrails on the IPO price: if the median step-up of the last 25 offerings is 1.4-1.5x, then that’s where they will typically start. Take a 40-50% premium to the price of the crossover round, and that’s often the mid-point of the valuation range. And with the crossovers providing significant insider participation in the IPO, they help to stabilize pricing around that expected range – or at least not below that range.



This crossover phenom has definitely contributed to the dramatic reduction in the frequency of “below the range” mispricings in the past few years.



New structural change: virtual IPO roadshow?



While crossover participation and the two major derisking elements of the JOBS Act are both continuing to support a vibrant IPO market, the reality is the traditional IPO process still creates a challenging tension on valuation for companies.



Crossover investors often just have a toehold position pre-IPO, and want to put a lot more capital to work in the IPO and beyond – so they aren’t necessarily incentivized for higher prices. The friendly cabal of thought- leader buyside accounts wield significant influence on how an IPO comes together.



Ultimately, it’s the sense of scarcity and demand that drives a truly

successful IPO, and this sentiment is often borne out of how the early “book-building” process happens in an IPO. Do you have just 1x of the expected raise “covered” with demand by the end of the first day, or is it 4- 5x? The faster that book builds, and with what quality, sends a very strong message to the market.



Traditionally, an IPO roadshow would take 7-9 days, interacting with 100+ investors and traveling all over the country. The IPO order book would build slowly at first, with many investors waiting to get a read of the sentiment from the underwriters. Further, the buyside would call each other and talk about the deal. There was always a weekend in between, when investors could further watch and wait to see how things were coming together. I won’t suggest there’s been collusion on constraining pricing, though there might be, but the orderly and rather prolonged process of the roadshow put most of the leverage on the side of the buyers, not the sellers (biotech).



This is where COVID comes in – and the launch of the virtual IPO roadshow. I think this is a structural change that flips that balance, helping biotechs regain some of the leverage and create a more efficient market for their offering.



The virtual IPO roadshow is typically only 4 days, and some stronger IPOs close their books on the night of the 3rd. Management teams “meet” the same number of investors, but they do it via videoconferencing without the travel friction and distractions. The book-building happens quickly, and exposes the company to less market volatility. If buysiders like the story, they can’t wait to see how the book builds over the first 5-6 days of a traditional roadshow. They need to put their orders in quickly or will miss



out. The virtual roadshow helps inject some FOMO into the biotech IPO process, and that’s a good thing for companies.



The data appear to support this conclusion: since the first virtual roadshow in April 2020, nearly every IPO has priced at or above the range (as shown in the charts above). Demand has been strong, and upsizing above the range has been a common occurrence.



Of course, overall sentiment towards biotech has been strong since hitting the bottom in March and has obviously been a positive force for driving IPO demand. If (when) that sentiment cools, there will certainly be some less successful IPOs, especially if the quality of the stories declines in frothier moments. That said, we’ve had strong periods for the biotech equity markets since 2012, with robust numbers of IPOs, and yet never saw pricing at or above the range with this frequency. I think, at least in part, the strength of the recent IPO market is the result of a structural change associated with the virtual 3-4 day roadshow process.



Critics might also say if so many biotechs are pricing above the range it means the underwriters are underpricing them. If valuations were low, I might share this view. But with IPO valuations moving upwards, as shown in the prior chart, it’s hard to see merit in that critique in aggregate - though there is certainly mispricing (up and down) on specific stories.



Today’s IPOs are some of the most highly-valued offerings we’ve ever seen, and the price setting mechanisms in the S1/IPO process are much more efficient than before. There are still challenges with how the IPO process enables companies to access the capital markets, which in large part explains the rise of SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) as an alternative path to “IPO” (and likely the subject of a future blog).

As we all know, a biotech IPO is really just a financing to help fuel an R&D pipeline – and today there’s much more capital being allocated to fund those pipelines. Of course, positive post-IPO performance is far more important than the IPO pricing event itself, and often reflects the generation of exciting data or deal-making that further advances the company’s prospects (or not).



But a healthy, efficient IPO process that unlocks strong demand in the equity markets is a critical step in the biotech lifecycle – and it’s evident there are many structural and market forces contributing to that positive dynamic today.



So what’s the next decade of IPO financings going to look like? Lots of reasons for optimism, but it’s anyone’s guess given how much has changed durably from a decade ago, and market cycles will always play a role."

Sign UpGeneration Bio Leads a Trio of Biotech Companies Aiming for the Nasdaq





ADVERTISEMENT

ADVERTISEMENTXconomy National — COVID-19 has ravaged the economy, and it was expected to quash the IPO market, too. But the biotech sector is defying the pandemic with crossover financings and freshly minted public companies. On Friday, three firms added their names to the list of life science companies preparing to join the public markets.



Gene therapy company Generation Bio, vaccines developer Vaxcyte, and cancer diagnostics maker Burning Rock Biotech each filed IPO paperwork just ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. The filings come as an index of

the largest and most liquid IPOs of the past two years reached an all-time high, according to Renaissance Capital. The IPO research firm says the index’s rise was led by Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA), the Cambridge, MA- based biotech that this week released preliminary Phase 1 data for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine.





“Investors are betting that new technologies and services are best suited for the post-pandemic world,” Renaissance says.



Here’s a look at the three new additions to the biotech IPO queue.



GENERATION BIO EYES NEXT-GEN GENE THERAPIES



Generation Bio aims to improve upon gene therapy with an alternative to the engineered viruses currently used to ferry these therapies into cells. Viral delivery has limitations that include safety risks and a relatively small genetic payload capacity, the Cambridge-based company says in its filing. Furthermore, if patients don’t already have antibodies to the viruses, they develop them after their first dose, which means patients can’t receive additional doses if the initial one doesn’t work as expected or stops working over time. Gene therapies that employ viral delivery are also expensive to manufacture.



Instead of a virus as its delivery vehicle, Generation Bio uses a lipid nanoparticle (LNP). The LNP encapsulates its genetic payload, a DNA construct called closed-ended DNA. This approach permits an individualized approach to treatment as a patient can be redosed until reaching the level needed for effective treatment, the company says. The technology also has a greater payload capacity and its less expensive to manufacture at scale compared to viral gene therapies. Those differences will enable delivery of gene therapies to more types of tissue, which in turn will allow for the treatment of a broader range of diseases spanning more patients, Generation Bio says.



Generation Bio’s initial focus is developing gene therapies targeting diseases of the liver and the eye. The most advanced liver programs are for phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited metabolic disorder, and hemophilia type A, the most common form of the bleeding disorder. For the eye, Generation Bio is developing a gene therapy for an inherited form of vision loss called Leber congenital amaurosis 10 (LCA10) and for Stargardt disease, which is a form of macular degeneration.



Those programs trail other experimental gene therapies that are currently in clinical testing. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) is developing a hemophila A gene therapy that came from the labs of partner Sangamo Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SGMO). BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDASQ: BMRN) is

testing gene therapies for hemophilia A and PKU. In LCA10, Editas Medicine (NASDAQ: EDIT) is developing a gene therapy under a partnership with Allergan, now a subsidiary of AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV). That therapeutic candidate uses the CRISPR gene-editing technology to correct the faulty gene inside the patient. All of these experimental gene therapies use adeno-associated viruses to reach their targets.



Generation Bio has raised more than $227 million, most recently a $110 million Series C financing in January. That funding round added crossover investors, whose involvement is viewed as an indication a company is preparing for an IPO. CEO Geoff McDonough acknowledged as much at the time, telling Xconomy he expected to take the company public in advance of beginning clinical trials. Other rare diseases that the company is exploring include Wilson’s disease and Gaucher disease.



In its filing, Generation Bio set a preliminary $125 million target for its IPO. The company has applied for a Nasdaq listing under the stock symbol “GBIO.” At the end of the first quarter of this year, Generation Bio reported having $104.5 million in cash. The company says it plans to use the IPO proceeds to continue R&D, including the preclinical work to support an application to start clinical testing of one of its liver disease gene therapies.



Generation Bio’s largest shareholders are Jason Rhodes, the company’s chairman and founding CEO, and Atlas Venture. Each holds a 37 percent pre-IPO stake, according to the filing. Fidelity Investment owns 14.9 percent of the company, followed by funds advised by T. Rowe Price, which hold 8.9 percent.



VAXCYTE SETS SIGHTS ON TOPPING A PFIZER VACCINE



Vaxcyte is the new name for SutroVax, which changed its moniker this week. The Foster City, CA-based company spun out of Sutro Biopharma, and it develops vaccines using technology licensed from its former parent. The company says in its IPO filing that its cell-free protein synthesis technology enables it to design protein carriers and antigens—a vaccine’s key components—that are better than what can be produced using conventional vaccine technologies.



Pneumococcal bacteria, which can cause pneumonia and meningitis, are Vaxcyte’s first target. The top pneumococcal vaccine, a Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) product called Prevnar 13, is a blockbuster seller that protects against 13 of the more than 90 pneumococcal strains. Vaxcyte’s preclinical vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is being developed to address 24 strains.



The IPO filing comes two months after Vaxyte closed a $110 million Series D round that added crossover investors. The company says in the filing that it has raised about $282 million cumulatively. As of March 31, Vaxcyte’s cash holdings totaled $154.7 million. The company’s largest shareholders include Abingworth Bioventures, Longitude Capial Management, and Roche Finance, though the percentages of those stakes were not disclosed.





Vaxcyte says it plans to apply for a Nasdaq listing under the stock symbol “PCVX.” The vaccine developer set a preliminary $100 million goal; proceeds will be used to complete preclinical development and advance VAX-24 into human testing. The cash will also finance manufacturing, as well as continued development of other vaccine candidates.



BURNING ROCK BIOTECH BLAZES A PATH TO NASDAQ



Burning Rock Biotech is based in China, where it sells next-generation sequencing products that help physicians select cancer treatments for their patients. Now it’s seeking a Nasdaq listing that will give US investors a chance to grab a stake.



The company says in its filing that it offers 13 tests spanning solid tumors including cancers of the lung, prostate, and breast, as well as blood cancers. In addition helping physicians treat cancer patients, Burning Rock says its products support clinical trials conducted by large pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN), Bayer, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). The company’s central laboratory processes biopsy samples from hospital patients as well as from its pharmaceutical partners. The central lab business is the company’s largest business segment.



Burning Rock reported $53.9 million in 2019 revenue. For the first quarter of 2020, revenue was $9.5 million. The company set a preliminary $100 million goal for its IPO, and says it plans to apply for a Nasdaq listing under the stock symbol “BNR.” According to the filing, Burning Rock expects to use the IPO cash for research and development of early cancer detection technologies, as well as for seeking approvals in China for additional cancer therapy selection products.

11,KES_Doc1_Joe-Biden-Gun-Control.docx,"President Joe Biden announced new efforts Wednesday to stem a rising national tide of violent crime, declaring the federal government is “taking on the bad actors doing bad things to our communities.” But questions persist about how effective the efforts can be in what could be a turbulent summer.



Crime rates have risen after plummeting during the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic, creating economic hardship and anxiety. Biden’s plan focuses on providing money to cities that need more police, offering community support and most of all cracking down on gun violence and those supplying illegal firearms.



“These merchants of death are breaking the law for profit,” Biden said. “If you willfully sell a gun to someone who’s prohibited, my message to you is this: We’ll find you and we’ll seek your license to sell guns. We’ll make sure you can’t sell death and mayhem on our streets.”



The steps he outlined are aimed at going hard after gun dealers who break federal law and establishing strike forces in several cities to help stop weapons trafficking. He also said he would seek more money for the agency that tracks the nation’s guns.



“This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement,” said Biden, who noted that “crime historically rises during the summer, and as we emerge from this pandemic the traditional summer spike may be even more pronounced than it usually would be.”



Biden announced a “zero tolerance” policy that would give no leeway to gun dealers who fail to comply with federal law — their licenses to sell would be revoked on a first offense.



The president has already announced a half-dozen executive actions on gun control, including going after “ghost guns,” homemade firearms that lack serial numbers for tracking and often are purchased without background checks.



A number of anti-crime and gun safety groups, including the Brady Campaign and Everytown for Gun Safety, applauded the administration’s efforts.



Legislation to expand background checks has so far stalled in the Senate after the House passed it in March, even though Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed then that the Senate would hold a vote on the bill.



Biden will seek increased transparency on gun data and better coordination among states, and he will push Congress for more money for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency responsible for enforcing federal gun laws and regulating gun dealers. The Justice Department is also launching strike forces in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., to help take down illegal gun traffickers.



While crime is rising — homicides and shootings are up from the same period last year in Chicago; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; Portland, Oregon; Baltimore; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Houston — violent crime overall remains lower than it was a decade ago or even five years ago. Most violent crimes plummeted during the first six months of the coronavirus pandemic, as people stayed indoors and away from others, then started creeping up last summer."
12,KES_Doc2_Joe-Biden-Gun-Control.docx,"Last week, President Joe Biden hosted Mr Guttenberg and other ""survivors of gun violence"" at a White House ceremony. He thanked them for their ""courage"" as he announced new executive actions to curb gun violence.



The measures are aimed at modifying federal firearms policy, drafting model legislation for states and investing in community violence intervention.



""Gun violence in this country is an epidemic and a national embarrassment,"" said Mr Biden.



He called on Congress to act urgently on firearm-related bills, particularly efforts to update background check laws for gun buyers and to close legal loopholes exploited in various shooting incidents around the country.



'A public health crisis'



Mass shootings, like the one that killed Jaime Guttenberg, are often headline-grabbing events. The month of March alone saw several.



Nearly 40,000 Americans die each year from gun violence. Almost two-thirds of those deaths typically come by suicide with a firearm. Homicide accounts for 35% of gun deaths, most frequently occurring in urban communities of colour and often affecting intimate partners, family members and young people.



Gun violence prevention advocates say the scope of the problem can no longer be captured by crime models or mental health frameworks. To them, it is a public health crisis that demands proactive efforts to address root causes, break cycles of violence and implement mitigating factors.



Partisan gridlock at the federal level has meant gun reforms have been slow to come.



Two bills to strengthen background checks on gun purchases have passed through the House of Representatives, but appear to lack adequate Republican support in the Senate.



Other firearms-related legislation, including two that tackle domestic violence prevention and racial justice in policing, face a similar fate.



A few Republicans have indicated a willingness to work with Democrats on these issues, but most have not. Some even taunt their liberal counterparts on gun control, with a challenge to ""come and take it"".



The National Rifle Association (NRA), the most powerful pro-gun lobby group, slammed the president's proposals last week as ""ill-conceived"" attempts ""at restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners"".



At the state and local level, in places as diverse as Virginia and Colorado, relentless advocacy has powered several successful efforts to strengthen gun laws, creating a potential framework for federal legislation.



Polls also show more than 80% of Americans support expanded backgrounds checks on gun buyers, so it is a good starting point for lawmakers in search of middle ground.



Mr Biden's actions are ""the opening salvo"", said Ms Jablon, and the bills awaiting congressional approval are ""the blueprint for a comprehensive plan to end our American gun violence epidemic"".



But gun rights supporters have hardened their positions in recent years, with lobbyists fighting back against nearly every gun control proposal and conservative politicians claiming the government was taking more and more drastic measures.



In response to Mr Biden's executive actions, the Second Amendment Foundation said he had ""declared war on tens of millions of law-abiding gun owners who have committed no crimes"" and - going further - the NRA said they would be a slippery slope to gun confiscation and prohibition."
13,KES_Doc3_Joe-Biden-Gun-Control.docx,"President Joe Biden pledged on Wednesday to go after illegal gun dealers and boost federal funding and support for local law enforcement as homicide rates have spiked in large cities.

""Merchants of death are breaking the law for profit,"" Biden said, adding the administration will have ""zero tolerance"" for rogue firearms dealers accountable for violating federal laws.

He said the government also will help states employ more police officers using funds already approved to help the economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

""My message to you is this,"" Biden said, addressing gun dealers who ""willfully"" break the law. ""We will find you and we'll seek your license to sell guns. We'll make sure you can't sell death and mayhem on our streets.""

The administration will strengthen efforts by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to stop illegal gun trafficking across states, Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the White House, reiterating steps the Department of Justice unveiled Tuesday.

In April, Biden signed executive orders asking the DOJ to crack down on self-assembled ""ghost guns."" Such orders allow Biden to act quickly without waiting for Congress, where Democrats hold a razor-thin majority and Republicans generally oppose gun control legislation.

Gun rights, protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, are among the thorniest political issues in America, where the rate of gun deaths exceeds other wealthy countries.

In 2020 homicides in large U.S. cities rose 30% from a year earlier while gun assaults rose 8% with the fastest rate in big cities including Chicago and Houston, the White House said, citing a report by the nonpartisan research group the Council on Criminal Justice.

The U.S. Treasury Department released information on how states and localities can tap the $350 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act to respond to violent crime, including by investing in community policing.

The administration faces growing impatience from gun-safety activists that want Biden to act more quickly to combat gun violence after he campaigned on a pledge to act against the ""epidemic"" on the first day of his administration.

This year, 20,989 Americans died of gun violence through June 23, more than half through suicide, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a research group.

The Republican Party issued a statement saying Biden's Democratic administration ""should have stood up to Democrats"" who do not sufficiently support law enforcement.

U.S. gun sales soared in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, amid social unrest over police killings of Black people and a contested presidential election. At the time, some experts warned a spike in homicides could be next.

""It's pretty clear that more guns is more death,"" Harvard University professor David Hemenway, director of the school’s Injury Control Research Center, which studies injury prevention, told Reuters in October.

While there is some ""preliminary evidence"" to support a connection between gun sales and homicides, ""more research is required,"" the Council on Criminal Justice report noted."
14,NF_DOC1_Biden-Immigration-Policy-Problem.docx,"The US-Mexico border crisis is one of the first noncoronavirus-related issues to break through the news cycle during President Joe Biden's administration. Republicans are playing up the surge of people trying to cross the border, while Democrats are hoping that Biden can figure out a way to deal with it.

The issue is one of the first that puts Biden and his administration between a rock and a hard place. It's not clear looking at the data how to politically deal with the issue.

For one thing, a flow of illegal immigration across the border divides the Democratic base.

Plenty of Democrats would like to essentially decriminalize crossing the border illegally. This was the stance that Vice President Kamala Harris took during her bid for the presidency in the 2020 election cycle. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polling in late 2019 showed that 51% of Democrats thought such a position was a good idea. This was especially true of the progressive base, among whom 61% thought it was a good idea.

Biden was one of the Democrats during the primary season not to endorse decriminalizing border crossings. He had to have known that few people outside the Democratic base wanted to do so. Only 42% of moderate Democrats did, and a mere 28% of registered voters overall believed decriminalizing border crossings is a good idea. A very large 65% believed decriminalizing border crossing was a bad idea.

So if voters don't want a decriminalized border, what do they want? It's not clear. A wall along the US-Mexico border, for instance, was pushed by former President Donald Trump. It proved to be unpopular with the public and certainly with the Democratic base.

Democrats have responded in another way: pushing immigration legislation of another sort that unites them. Specifically, House Democrats passed a bill that seeks to find a path to citizenship for many immigrants who are here illegally. Polling shows that most Americans are in favor of a path to citizenship for most people who are in the country illegally, but its chances in the Senate don't look great at the current moment because of GOP opposition.

Of course, there's a major difference in the minds of the voters for immigrants who are newly coming over the border illegally and those who have been in the country for a substantial period of time. The Democratic legislation doesn't really solve the current issues at the border.

Republicans, recognizing that fact, have opposed such bills. They're hoping to keep the issue of immigration in the news longer because a lot of the attention is on the current border situation.

Moreover, Republicans understand their base tends to be far more fired up about immigration than the Democrats are. Last year, Trump's voters were 15 points more likely to say that immigration was very important to their vote than Biden's voters in Pew Research Center polling.

The last time Republicans were trying to take back the House in a midterm election (2010), voters who selected immigration as one of their top issues were more than twice as likely to say they were voting Republican."
15,NF_DOC2_Immigration-Advocates-Look-To-Biden.docx,"The president has been praised for following through on some major campaign promises, but he has also left unfulfilled others and suffered some self-inflicted wounds.

On Day One of his presidency, Joe Biden signed six immigration-related executive actions and outlined a sweeping immigration reform measure that would create a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.

The actions were not only substantive but symbolic of Biden's stated commitment to reverse former President Donald Trump's hard-line policies, restore humanity to the immigration system and place immigration at the top of his domestic agenda.

When Biden hit the 100-day mark, he had taken 94 executive actions on immigration, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute – more than triple enacted by Trump in the same time frame. More than half of those actions have been aimed at undoing Trump-era policies.

But his record so far has invited mixed responses from advocates. While the president has been praised for following through on some major campaign promises, he has also left unfulfilled others and bumbled through some self-inflicted wounds – most notably when he in April reneged on a campaign promise and kept the refugee admissions cap at the previous administration's historic low before quickly announcing plans to change course in the face of extreme backlash. He eventually raised the ceiling to 62,500 in early May.

Though Biden's immigration actions have included significant moves like defunding border wall construction and winding down the former administration's controversial asylum program at the southern border, the administration's efforts have been overshadowed by an influx of unaccompanied migrant minors at the border that has sent the government scrambling and, officials say, diverted resources and attention from other areas of immigration policy.

Republicans have seized on the border situation, labeling it a crisis and relentlessly pushing it as evidence of the Biden's administration's incompetence, positioning the issue squarely at the forefront of their 2022 midterm elections campaign. Even the Wi-Fi password for the House GOP retreat last month was ""Biden Border Crisis.""

The White House, meanwhile, has rebuffed the ""crisis"" label but has largely failed to counter that narrative and draw public attention to its actions in other areas of immigration policy. More than half of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of the border, according to a recent poll.

Recent signs suggest the situation at the border is stabilizing and facilities that were once grossly overcrowded are under capacity. Advocates and others say they are now closely watching the Biden administration's actions over the next several months for how aggressively it will not only pursue the immigration agenda the president has already laid out but communicate those efforts.

""They're making progress. They're holding their nerve. And the question is, in the next 100 days, are they going to get back on offense? Are they going to get on the front foot and off the back foot?"" says Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of America's Voice, a left-leaning immigration advocacy group."
16,NL-Doc1-Biden-infrastructure-proposal.docx,"Now that his massive coronavirus relief package is law, President Joe Biden is laying out his next big proposal: A roughly $2 trillion plan for improving the nation's infrastructure and shifting to greener energy over the next 8 years.

The President plans to pay for this part of his recovery package by raising corporate taxes -- a core campaign promise the administration says would raise more than $2 trillion over the next 15 years.



Transportation: $621 billion

Funding improvements to roads, bridges, railways and other infrastructure has been a central piece of Biden's recovery plans. He has said that it will create ""really good-paying jobs"" and help the nation compete better.

Biden would spend $621 billion on roads, bridges, public transit, rail, ports, waterways, airports and electric vehicles in service of improving air quality, reducing congestion and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.



Home care services and workforce: $400 billion

Biden would provide $400 billion to bolster caregiving for aging and disabled Americans.

His plan would expand access to long-term care services under Medicaid, eliminating the wait list for hundreds of thousands of people. It would provide more opportunity for people to receive care at home through community-based services or from family members.



Manufacturing: $300 billion

Biden wants to put $300 billion toward boosting manufacturing.

Under his plan, $50 billion of the money would be invested in semiconductor manufacturing and another $30 billion would go towards medical manufacturing to help shore up the nation's ability to respond to a future outbreak.





Housing: $213 billion

The plan would invest $213 billion toward building, renovating and retrofitting more than two million homes and housing units.

Biden is calling on Congress to produce, preserve and retrofit more than a million affordable and energy efficient housing units. The plan would also build and rehabilitate more than 500,000 homes for low- and middle-income homebuyers.



Research and development: $180 billion

Biden is calling on Congress to invest $180 billion to advance US leadership in critical technologies, upgrade the US's research infrastructure and establish the US as a leader in climate science, innovation and research and development.



Water: $111 billion

Biden's plan allocates $111 billion to rebuild the country's water infrastructure.

It would replace all of the nation's lead pipes and service lines in order to improve the health of American children and communities of color. The White House says replacing the pipes would reduce lead exposure in 400,000 schools and childcare facilities.



Schools: $100 billion

Biden calls for $100 billion to build new public schools and upgrade existing buildings with better ventilation systems, updated technology labs, and improved school kitchens that can prepare more nutritious meals.





Digital infrastructure: $100 billion

Biden wants to invest $100 billion in order to give every American access to affordable, reliable and high-speed broadband.



Workforce development: $100 billion

The President would allocate $100 billion to workforce development -- helping dislocated workers, assisting underserved groups and getting students on career paths before they graduate high school.



Veterans' hospitals and federal buildings: $18 billion

The plan would provide $18 billion to modernize the Veterans Affairs' hospitals, which are on average more than 40 years older than a private sector hospital, according to the White House.

It also calls for $10 billion to modernize federal buildings."

President Joe Biden hit his goal 200 million vaccinations in his first 100 days Thursday.



It wasn't a stretch: The country hit the goal with seven days to spare, and according to an NBC News analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures, from the day Biden announced his new 200 million goal, the country was on a pace to reach that goal.



In Biden's first press conference on March 25, he announced the new 200 million goal. On Jan. 25, Biden had upped his Covid-19 vaccination goal to 150 million shots in arms in his first 100 days in office. Then Jan. 26, shortly after this article was first published, Biden backed away from 150 million and restated his 100 million goal. In the days and weeks before entering office, he said his goal was 100 million vaccinations.



While Biden’s chief of staff had called the 100 million goal “ambitious,” the vaccination rate necessary to reach the mark is not much higher than what the rate was Jan. 20.



The Biden administration has until the end of the day April 29 to reach the target.



Use this graphic to follow whether the country is on track to reach the administration’s goal. Note that total vaccinations given — as in first and second shots, both shots counting individually — are what’s being counted. This is not the same as full vaccinations, which are first and second shots counted as one. Biden specifically mentioned shots in arms in his statements about the goal."
18,PDA_Doc1_Anti-Vaccine-Disinformation.docx,"Sayer Ji is a 48-year-old proponent of what he calls natural medicine.

""My parents didn't know about natural medicine, so it really wasn't until I was 17 that I learned some basic principles of nutrition and self-care,"" he told attendees at a recent virtual conference. ""I was liberated from needing pharmaceutical medicines.""

Ji was also there promoting his website, full of natural remedies and reams of anti-vaccine misinformation. He sells subscriptions for anywhere from $75 to $850 a year.

He is one of many anti-vaccine advocates with a business on the side. They promote false claims about the dangers vaccines pose, while selling treatments, supplementals or other services. Their potential market is the roughly 20% of Americans say they do not want to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to recent polling.

Health experts worry that the misinformation being spread is doing real damage. Without sufficient vaccination, communities could see a resurgence of the virus, particularly in the coming fall and winter months.

Ji has spent years pushing scientifically disproven views about vaccines and other conventional medical treatments, but the coronavirus pandemic gave him and others in the anti-vaccine community a new set of talking points. ""This is the new medical apartheid, this is the new biosegregation that they want to roll out across the world,"" he warned of the vaccination campaigns during a lengthy Facebook video posted earlier this year.

""COVID was the opportunity,"" says Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit group that tracks anti-vaccination misinformation. ""COVID generated a lot of anxiety and conspiracies and misinformation thrive where there is anxiety.""

As people have searched online for information on the virus and vaccines, Ji and others have upped their rhetoric, while continuing to promote their books, workshops, and other products. Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate shows it can work, as 147 key anti-vaccination accounts have managed to grow their followings by at least 25% since the start of the pandemic.

And Ahmed believes for those with something to sell, anti-vaccine misinformation serves a second important purpose.

""One of the things that antivaxxers have to do to sell their own remedies ... is to persuade people not to trust authorities they've trusted in the past,"" Ahmed says.

By using their debunked theories to turn people away from mainstream medicine, these entrepreneurs are creating customers: ""Once they've managed to hook someone, they can then sell to them for a lifetime.""

That selling can be big business. One of the leading anti-vaccine advocates, Joseph Mercola, is believed to bring in millions each year through his companies, which sell an array of branded natural supplements, beauty products and even pet supplies. In a written statement to NPR, Mercola's company said he ""rejects your biased accusation of promoting misinformation.""

""I mean I'm a published author, so I encourage people listening to buy my book if they're interested. How about that. So there it is, I've just promoted something, I'm a shill for the anti-vax industry,"" he said."
19,PDA_Doc2_COVID-Vaccines-Disinformation .docx,"Halting the spread of the coronavirus will require a high-level counteroffensive against new destructive forces.

Nearly one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in less than six months, but anti-vaccine disinformation and targeted attacks on scientists are undermining progress. These threats must be confronted directly, and the authority and expertise of the health community alone aren’t enough to do this.

Even before the pandemic, I had a front-row seat to all of this. I have co-led efforts to develop vaccines in programs, including a COVID-19 vaccine currently being tested in India. I also have an adult daughter with autism; my 2018 book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism, became a dog whistle for anti-vaccine activists.

The World Health Organization recognized vaccine hesitancy as a top threat to global health before the pandemic. As COVID-19 vaccines moved through development, the public-health communities anticipated considerable vaccine hesitancy. Teams of experts, including me, began meeting regularly online to discuss how best to amplify evidence-based messages, deliver public-service announcements and address concerns around COVID-19 immunization.

I experienced sinking feelings during our Zoom calls. Although certainly worthwhile, I knew that messaging alone would be inadequate. We’d already seen this inadequacy in our efforts to prevent measles from returning to the United States and Europe in 2019, and to bolster vaccination rates for human papillomavirus to prevent cervical and other cancers. With COVID-19, our pro-vaccine messages would be drops in a vast sea of misinformation, much of it poured in deliberately by anti-vaccine forces.

I have a long-standing disagreement with many of my US public-health colleagues. I admire their commitment to disease prevention, but when I ask for a more direct way to counter anti-vaccine aggression, I’m told, “that’s not our approach; confrontation gives them a platform and oxygen.” In my opinion, this attitude reflects a time when we had dial-up modems. Today, the anti-vaccine empire has hundreds of websites and perhaps 58 million followers on social media. The bad guys are winning, in part because health agencies either underestimate or deny the reach of anti-science forces, and are ill-equipped to counter it.

Investigations by the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office have described how Russian intelligence organizations seek to discredit Western COVID-19 vaccines. One campaign implies that it could turn people into monkeys. This builds on a longer, well-documented history of Russia-sponsored disinformation, presumably to destabilize the United States and other democratic countries. The administration of US President Joe Biden has warned Russian media groups to halt their anti-vaccine aggression, and announced sanctions tied to disinformation and other behavior, but we need much more.

The United States hosts the world’s largest and best-organized anti-vaccine groups. According to the London-based Center for Countering Digital Hate, these are influential groups, not a spontaneous grass-roots movement. Many far-right extremist groups that spread false information about last year’s US presidential election are doing the same about vaccines. Anti-vaccine groups also target Black communities; an anti-vaccine documentary released in March vilifies COVID-19 vaccine testing among African Americans, calling it “medical racism”."
20,PDA_Doc3_Anti-Vaxxers-Wage-Campaigns.docx,"People who are hesitant about getting the COVID-19

Vaccine don't have to work hard to find internet rumors and theories that will fuel their fears regarding the vaccine's safety.

That's because anti-vaccine groups and individuals are working overtime to promote frightening, false theories about the two COVID-19 vaccines that have now been administered to more than 24 million Americans, infectious disease experts say.

""These kind of rumors have been around ever since Edward Jenner made his smallpox vaccine in the late1700s,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""There was a belief if you got the vaccine, which was derived from cowpox, that you would take on bovine characteristics. You'd get a snout, you'd get a tail, you'd get floppy ears. That was the internet 1802, basically.""

There are two major types of disinformation being promulgated about the coronavirus vaccines:

Anecdotal ""cause-and-effect"" rumors that erroneously tie a person's untimely demise to the fact they recently got a COVID-19 vaccine.

""Big lie"" conspiracy theories that allege the vaccine can cause all manner of major side effects, from Infertility to permanently altering your genetics.

Health care workers had braced for stories coming out that tie people's personal health problems and untimely deaths to their recent vaccination, even though there's no evidence linking the two.

For example, vaccine opponents recently pounced on the death of Florida obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Gregory Michael, 56, who died Jan. 3 after suffering a catastrophic drop in platelets (cell fragments in the bloodstream that control bleeding).

Posts tying Michael's demise to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine flooded the internet, despite a lack of clinical evidence linking his death to the vaccination 18 days prior.

It's not the first such instance of a person dying after they get the vaccine, and it won't be the last because coincidences happen every day, Offit said.

""Hank Aaron gets the vaccine. Two weeks later he dies of a stroke. Why? Because he was in his late 80s, and people in their late 80s can die of strokes,"" Offit said. ""The vaccine doesn't make you immortal.""

Separating fact from fiction

Now that millions of people have received the vaccines -- including more than 3 million who have completed the full two-dose regimen -- experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to truly sort out real, rare side effects caused by the vaccine from coincidental illnesses and deaths, Offit said.

""There's always going to be these temporal associations, always, and you just have to calm yourself down and wait until the CDC says, 'You know something, there is a rare side effect here.' Because they're looking. They're looking every day,"" Offit said.

Aside from rare cases of anaphylactic shock that occur within a few minutes of receiving the injection, no other dangerous side effects have commonly cropped up in the millions of doses that have been administered, experts said.

The other sort of anti-vaccine rumor, the ""big lie,"" involves highly specific conspiracy theories related to safety and side effects."
21,PJB_Doc1_Harris-Border-Visit.docx,"Vice President Harris visits the U.S.-Mexico border Friday in El Paso, Texas, after weeks of badgering by Republicans and at the urging of some Democrats. This will be the highest-level Biden administration visit to the border in the midst of a record surge of migrants.

Harris is in charge of the thorny issue of migration from Central America at a time when the government has struggled to keep up with an influx of people seeking asylum at the southern border.

President Biden had promised a more humane approach to immigration enforcement than the Trump administration, and after he took office, the number of people crossing the border surged.

Back in March, Biden tasked Harris with addressing the root causes of the migration crisis, a role he had when he was vice president during an earlier spike in border crossings. Although the White House was careful to emphasize that her role was meant to be a diplomatic one, working with the Central American countries driving the arrivals, critics immediately asked why the ""border czar"" was avoiding the border. That's not actually a title she ever had.

The Biden administration had intentionally avoided having Harris visit the border until now, though as a senator from California she had made the trip.

The root causes of migration are long-standing and seemingly intractable, including poverty, violence, natural disasters, climate change and corruption. But they are also less politically charged than border enforcement and the challenge of dealing with families and unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in the United States.

In an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, she seemed dismissive of calls to visit the border, saying she hadn't been to Europe yet, either, setting off GOP criticism.

Harris later explained that she felt the focus on the border missed the point. ""We cannot be simplistic and assume that there is only one element or way of approaching the overall problem,"" she said.

Some have questioned why Harris would choose El Paso rather than the Rio Grande Valley, where many more of the recent border apprehensions have taken place. Hinting at Harris' likely message, her spokeswoman Symone Sanders told reporters that El Paso had been the ""birthplace"" of former President Donald Trump's family separation policy.

The Trump administration had run a pilot program in El Paso of arresting parents for illegally crossing the border and moving their children, including babies, into the custody of the Health and Human Services Department.

The Biden administration has sought to shift blame for the border conditions to the Trump administration, arguing they left a broken immigration system, with efforts at addressing the root causes of migration neglected in favor of an enforcement-only approach.

The trip comes a few days before Trump is set to visit the border with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. In a statement, Trump claimed his plans prompted Harris' border stop, even though she had committed to going while in Mexico City earlier this month.

Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar, whose district includes 300 miles of the border, had urged Harris to visit. Cuellar praised the trip when it was announced earlier this week."
22,PJB_Doc2_What-is-Biden-doing-border.docx,"What is Biden doing differently at US border?



Here's a look at what Mr Biden has - and hasn't - done so far, and how it differs from Mr Trump.



Refugee cap

In April, Mr Biden stunned his supporters by announcing plans to only allow 15,000 refugees into the US in 2021. The annual refugee cap was set by Mr Trump the year before, and was an historic low.

Mr Biden soon reversed course following a backlash, and raised the number to 62,500 refugees. He also pledged to increase the refugee cap in 2022 to 125,000.



About 110,000 refugees were admitted to the US in the last year of Barack Obama's final presidential term.



Separating families

Over 178,000 people were arrested crossing the border in April, the most ever recorded in a single month.

Some 16,933 were children who were not travelling with their legal guardian encounters in April, down slightly from March figures, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data.

The previous monthly high of 11,000 lone children recorded in May 2019 came during Mr Trump's presidency.

The influx of minors swiftly overwhelmed migration processing facilities and saw thousands of children put in CBP facilities originally designed to hold adults.

Mr Biden's critics have suggested that holding children in those detention facilities harkens back to a Trump-era policy, the major change being that children are held for less time under President Biden.

The numbers of children held by CBP dropped by 88% by early May, as the children were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services for temporary resettlement as their immigration case is heard by the courts.

Massive drop in children held by border officials



The Remain in Mexico policy

On Mr Biden's first day in office, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspended a controversial Trump-era policy that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US immigration hearings.

About 70,000 migrants were enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) - informally known as the Remain in Mexico programme - since it was introduced in January 2019.



Border wall

After coming into office vowing not to build ""another foot"" of Mr Trump's border wall, Mr Biden signed an order on his first day in office to pause all wall construction and to end the national emergency declaration on the southern border.

Property owners near the border have complained that despite the pause, the government is still seeking to seize border lands for future construction using a process known as eminent domain.



How are migrants entering the US?

Migrants cross the border in one of two ways.

Those who ""have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution"" in their home country are eligible for asylum when they present themselves at a port of entry for admission into the US.

Others may evade immigration inspectors and border patrol by hiding in vehicles or travelling undetected across unprotected - and typically treacherous - sections of the US-Mexico border.

According to the Pew Research Center, at least 40% of unauthorised migrants in the country entered legally on short-term visas and overstayed."
23,PSG_Doc1_Why-Cubans-see-embargo.docx,"Havana — Cuban's don't wake up or go to bed with the words ""U.S. economic, commercial and financial embargo"" on the tips of their tongues. But if there is a thought lingering in the back of many minds here, just one word — ""blockade"" — probably covers it. It frequently rolls off tongues as people discuss their daily hardships.



Many Cubans watched on Wednesday as the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to approve a resolution condemning the United States' six-decade embargo on their island. They were most interested to see whether the U.S. would abstain from the vote, as the Obama administration did in 2016, or vote ""No"" again, as it did under former President Trump.



The COVID-19 pandemic has made Cuba's medical professionals, and people seeking protection from or treatment for the virus, hyper-aware of the negative impact of the blockade.



In a Facebook post, Foreign Ministry official Johanna Tablada pointed out that in 2020, two long-time German providers of laboratory and other medical supplies, Sartorious and Merck, both stopped selling to the island — for fear, she said, of the sanctions the U.S. was applying internationally. This, she said, prevented Cuba from obtaining purification equipment needed as it worked to develop its COVID vaccines.

The country managed without the supplies from Germany, and it is now giving doses of two domestically produced vaccines that have shown good efficacy.



A medical equipment specialist verifies the operation of an artificial respiration device built by the Cuban medical technology manufacturer ComBiomed, in Havana, March 31, 2021. Cuba opted to build much of its own technological arsenal to deal with COVID-19 due to the U.S. embargo and the lack of foreign currency in the country.



""Cuba maintains and will maintain its achievements despite the many shortages and need of our people provoked by the blockade,"" said Dr. Osvaldo Mendez Diaz of Havana's Tropical Medicine Institute, IPK, which treated the first COVID-19 cases in the country in March 2020.

He told CBS News that he was encouraged by the public health intervention in Havana, using the Cuban Abdala vaccine, which reduced by nearly 50% the number of confirmed cases in the capital in May, and has continued to drive a significant drop in new cases in more recent weeks.



""In addition to the victory [with the U.N. vote], Cuba is happy that it has achieved effective vaccines against COVID-19 amidst the toughening of the blockade,"" said the frontline doctor, barely identifiable through all of his PPE.

However, like most Cubans, Mendez Diaz believes the blockade is holding back the country's progress, and that more lives could have been saved, and could be saved going forward, if the U.S. embargo wasn't cutting off Cuba's access to some supplies.



In a statement explaining the vote against the U.N. resolution on Wednesday, American diplomat Rodney Hunter told the gathered body that U.S. ""stands with the Cuban people and seeks to support their pursuit of freedom, prosperity, and a future of greater dignity,"" but he called the ongoing sanctions ""a legitimate way to achieve foreign policy, national security, and other national and international objectives."""
24,PSG_Doc2_New-Cuba-policy.docx,"Five months into his administration, President Biden’s campaign promise to “go back” to the Obama policy of engagement with Cuba remains unfulfilled, lodged in a low-priority file somewhere between “too hard” and “not worth it.”



“I would say that 2021 is not 2015,” when Obama reestablished full diplomatic relations with Havana and opened the door to increased U.S. travel and trade with the communist-ruled island, only to see Donald Trump slam it closed again, a senior administration official said.

“We have an entire world and a region in disarray,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “We are combating a pandemic, and dealing with a breaking down of democracy in a whole host of countries. That is the environment we are in. When it comes down to Cuba, we’ll do what’s in the national security interest of the United States.”



Cuba has done itself, and Biden, no favors in seeking a new rapprochement, with recent crackdowns on dissident artists, journalists and academics, and ongoing support for repressive regimes in Venezuela and Nicaragua. At the same time, new attention is being paid in Washington to a mysterious brain malady — believed to be the result of targeted attacks — that struck American diplomats and other officials in countries across the globe, including many in Cuba.

Biden struggles to sell democracy abroad when it faces challenges at home

But if the current state of the world and national security demands on the administration make addressing the relationship with Cuba one hard problem too many, what makes it not worth the effort is a purely domestic matter. For the most part, it comes down to two words: Robert Menendez.

The Democratic senator from New Jersey, the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is a key player in issues the administration sees as far more important than Cuba in a Senate evenly split along party lines. The U.S.-born son of immigrants from pre-communist Cuba, he is strongly against reopening the door to Havana.



The administration has no business reaching out to Cuba, Menendez has said repeatedly, unless its government “takes steps to restore and respect” the rights of its citizens. With a large New Jersey constituency of Cuban Americans, he has long been focused on policy toward Havana and opposed the Obama initiative as endorsing the “brutal behavior” of the Cuban government while getting nothing in return.

Those who backed Obama’s move supported his argument that decades of diplomatic opposition and covert operations against the Fidel Castro government and its successors had moved Cuba no closer to freedom and democracy. Echoing Obama, Biden’s campaign pitch was that allowing more Americans to travel, send money and sell things to Cuba was the best way to erode support for the communist regime.

Trump’s reversals, Biden said during his campaign, “have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.”



But after losing Florida to Trump — whose charges that Biden would turn the United States into a “socialist” country resonated with Cuban Americans and other Latinos — he quickly promised consultation with Congress and a full-scale review of U.S. policy toward Havana."
25,RMB_Doc1_Cyber-Attacks-Against-Russian-Hackers.docx,"‘They are hair on fire’: Biden admin mulling cyber attacks against Russian hackers

The Biden administration is moving to treat ransomware attacks as a national security threat, using intelligence agencies to spy on foreign criminals and contemplating offensive cyber operations against hackers inside Russia.

Criminal ransomware attacks from abroad have become a major source of economic damage, as the disruption of gasoline and meat supplies in recent weeks has illustrated.

The White House was unusually quick to point the finger at Russia for harboring the attackers one day after officials learned of the ransomware strike on meat processor JBS. In previous incidents, it took weeks or months for the U.S. government to publicly blame another country as the source of a cyber attack.

As the onslaught of ransomware attacks against hospitals and local governments increased in the summer of 2019, the NSA began spying on certain foreign criminal hacker groups. Officials say intelligence puts the U.S. in a better position to target the groups if the president orders a strike.

Ransomware attacks have for years been treated as purely criminal matters, investigated by the FBI with an eye toward prosecution. Criminal accountability was rare because most of the hackers reside in Russia and other places outside the reach of American law enforcement. Russia allows the hackers to operate without interference as long as they are attacking the West, U.S. officials say.

As the NSA began assembling data on ransomware groups, hospital systems were hit last fall by another wave of attacks.

An attack last month led to gasoline shortages, and a strike against meat processing firm JBS threatened a quarter of America’s meat processing capacity. Had JBS not gotten back online quickly —presumably by paying a ransom —Americans might have experienced significant meat shortages.

In a typical ransomware attack, hackers break into a corporate network and lock up data, demanding payment to release it. Some also threaten to post business secrets on the internet if payment is not made.

Successful ransomware attacks often take advantage of companies with substandard cyber defenses, but hackers with enough time and money would find a way to get through. That’s why the Biden administration is contemplating ways to deter ransomware gangs and the countries that give them sanctuary, principally Russia.

Experts do not anticipate Putin caving to U.S. demands. If he doesn’t, Biden will have options, including offensive action by military hackers wielding cyber weapons.

The military would be careful to operate in a gray area short of an act of war under international law. That’s what Russia has been doing to the U.S. with a campaign of disinformation, election interference and hacking.

Some believe the military should only be used as a last resort to an imminent threat. Military force has been used against criminals before in raids to free American hostages.

In August 2020 U.S. Cyber Command took down a Trickbot, a botnet used to deploy ransomware. That was the first known use of military force against criminal hackers justified as a measure to prevent election interference, because Trickbot also could have disrupted the 2020 elections."
26,RMB_Doc2_Superpower-Summits-Biden-Putin-Cyberweapons.docx,"Once, Superpower Summits Were About Nukes. Now, It’s Cyberweapons.

As President Biden prepares to meet President Putin on Wednesday, cyberweapons are elevated to the top of the agenda.

Russia and the United States, the two most skilled adversaries in the cyber arena, have a growing arsenal of techniques in a daily, low-level conflict. 

The rising tempo and sophistication of attacks on American infrastructure revealed vulnerabilities no president can ignore.

A decade of intensifying cyberconflict has taught traditional deterrence tools deterrence largely failed.

While Putin loves to boast about his investments in nuclear torpedoes and hypersonic weapons, he knows he cannot use them. His arsenal of cyberweapons is put to work every day.

Biden intends to give Putin a choice: Cease attacks and crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russia, or face rising economic costs and US moves to “respond in kind.” Putin may ignore him.

Arms control treaties, the main tool in the nuclear age, are not adapted to the cyberrealm. There are too many players — nations, criminal groups, terrorist organizations — and no way to do the equivalent of counting warheads and missiles.

Their hope is to get Putin discussing targets that should be off the table in peacetime, including electric grids, election systems, water and energy pipelines, nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons command-and-control systems.

Putin refuses to acknowledge that Russia uses these weapons, suggesting accusations are an American disinformation campaign.

The ease with which he can deny knowledge of cyberoperations demonstrates why Cold War deterrents won’t work with digital threats.

America knew every Soviet weapon location and who had authority to fire them. In cyberage, there is no way to count threats or figure who has the modern-day “button.” It was clear what would happen to a country that unleashed its weapons on the US. In the cyberage it is anything but clear.

The response to Russian influence the 2016 election came after results were in. Obama’s reaction was the expulsion of Russian diplomats and the closing of some diplomatic compounds.

Then Trump. America lost four years in which it could have been trying to set some global standards.

What worries the Biden team is not the volume of attacks, but their sophistication.

The SolarWinds attack was not just another hack: Roughly 1,000 SVR hackers were involved in a complex effort that got Russians into the supply chain of software funneled into government agencies, companies and think tanks. Worse, the attack was from inside the United States because Russians knew American intelligence agencies are forbidden to operate on U.S. soil.

Biden wanted a “proportional response,” and settled on more economic sanctions. It is far from clear those left an impression.

SolarWinds was followed by surge in ransomware attacks, extortion schemes locking up a company or hospital’s data demanding millions in Bitcoin to unlock it. Biden has accused Russia of harboring those groups.

If history of nuclear arms control applies, expectations should be low. It is too late to eliminate cyberweapons. The best hope might be a first attempt at a digital “Geneva Convention” limiting cyberweapons against civilians.

That is almost certainly further than Putin will go. With his economy overly dependent on fossil fuels and his population showing restiveness, his sole remaining superpower is disruption of democratic rivals."

The Department of Energy is asking Congress for $201 million for 2022 to address digital vulnerabilities after a steady uptick in sweeping cyberattacks.

The $201 million request, up from $157 million in 2021, will bolster the agency’s cybersecurity efforts and address “gaps” in the supply chain and tech infrastructure.

Secretary of Energy told the department needs funding to upgrade software, hire more cybersecurity professionals and develop new cyber policies and standards.

“The Colonial Pipeline incident made it clear that the fact that we do not have cyber standards on pipelines like we do on the electricity sector, that suggests a major hole,” Granholm said referencing a sweeping ransomware attack on the nation’s largest gasoline pipeline.

She said the Biden administration was reviewing methods the private sector could better collaborate with the government on cyberattacks.

The Biden administration is asking for $9.8 billion for federal civilian cybersecurity, nearly a 15% increase over 2021. The Pentagon is requesting $10.4 billion for cybersecurity.

Increased investment in cybersecurity follows steady ransomware attacks that directly impacted Americans and hampered logistics and services in the US.

Washington formally held Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service responsible for the SolarWinds cyberattack. Microsoft described the assault as “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.” Microsoft’s systems were also infected with malicious software.

The Russian government denies allegations it was behind the SolarWinds hack.

Last month, a hacking group known as DarkSide with suspected ties to Russian criminals launched a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, forcing the U.S. company to shut approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline. It disrupted nearly half the East Coast’s fuel supply and caused gasoline shortages in the Southeast and airline disruptions.

After the DarkSide attack, Biden told reporters, “So far there is no evidence from our intelligence people that Russia is involved although there is evidence that the actor’s ransomware is in Russia, they have some responsibility to deal with this.”

Colonial Pipeline paid the $5 million ransom to cybercriminals.

Before Blount testified, U.S. law enforcement recovered $2.3 million in bitcoin from the hacker group.

The FBI warned victims of ransomware attacks paying a ransom could encourage further malicious activity.

Less than a month after the cyber assault on Colonial Pipeline, JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker announced it had fallen victim to a ransomware attack. The breach disrupted meat production in North America and Australia, triggering concerns over rising meat prices.

The company paid $11 million in ransom to a different Russian-based cybercriminal group, but not before it briefly shut down its entire U.S. operation.

Biden raised cyberattacks with his Russian counterpart.

“Certain critical infrastructures should be off-limits to attack, period, by cyber or any other means,” Biden said during a news conference. “I gave them a list, 16 specific entities defined as critical infrastructure under U.S. policy, from the energy sector to water systems.”

Biden’s identification of critical infrastructure as off-limits suggests government response could be taken should state or nonstate actors attack those sectors.

Putin denied knowledge of or involvement in the attacks."
28,YG_Doc1_America-Great-Science-Terrible-Politics.docx,"Although NASA and university scientists make this look easy, we know that is not the case.The current landing is the fifth rover America has placed on Mars, and Perseverence is poised to make major scientific breakthroughs. It has equipment onboard that can test for the remnants of microbial life in the ancient lake bed where it landed. It is equipped with a helicopter that can provide an overview of the area to be explored. It can scoop up and store rocks that eventually will be brought back to Earth for more intensive analysis.

Our nation is also a leader in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, neuroscience, genetics, semiconductor development, and many other areas. Indeed, our institutions of higher learning attract talented students from around the globe and are considered among the best in the world.

In contrast, our political operations are crumbling. Our government was organized 230 years ago in a highly agrarian society, and the founders required two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of state legislatures to approve any major institutional changes. Though there have been 27 successful amendments to the Constitution, it is very difficult to update our institutional arrangements for an economy and society that have been transformed since 1789.

The challenge of making structural improvements means that as our country has urbanized, become more diverse, seen much of its economic activity migrate to the coasts, and been globalized, it is hard to update our institutions to reflect those changing realities.

The high level of political misinformation would never be tolerated in science. If Mars scientists launched Perseverance based on false theories or fake information, it would not have landed safely on Mars. Yet there is no parallel corrective mechanism for truth or facts in the political world as leaders can spout lies without being held accountable for their inaccuracies. 

Our scientific culture explicitly encourages new thinking and innovative practices, and rewards successful innovators. Experts who develop new approaches receive Nobel prizes that glorify their creativity. The opposite is true in public affairs. Innovation is not rewarded and efforts to improve political performance are derided as misguided leadership.

The central challenge facing the United States is the rise of anti-majoritarian elements within many of our leading political institutions. For example, the Electoral College violates “one person, one vote” principles by overrepresenting small and medium-sized states and underrepresenting large states. A person’s vote in Wyoming and Idaho counts for more than someone’s in California, New York, or Texas. 

Our political structures overweight the interests of a minority of the nation’s population. American politics is not representative of the entire country, and institutions have not been sufficiently updated to reflect how the country has changed since 1789. The contemporary system engenders extremism and hyper-partisanship that prevents us from addressing the roots causes such as income inequality and geographic disparities that disturb many voters.

If we are not careful, our political dysfunction could endanger our scientific and technological expertise. Unless we make meaningful changes that improve political representation and institutional performance, we risk a future where both our politics and science are terrible. That would be a catastrophic outcome for the United States and endanger our economy, society, and global leadership."
29,YG_Doc2_China-Artificial-Intelligence-Superpower.docx,"China is on its way to becoming the first global superpower for Artificial Intelligence.

The People's Republic of China has the most ambitious AI strategy of all nations and provides the most resources worldwide for its implementation.

China combines a gigantic amount of data with talent, companies, research and capital to build the world's leading AI ecosystem.

China aims to become the world's largest economic power and to provide its people with adequate prosperity guaranteed by a politically stable system. In addition, China is ensuring that economic, military and diplomatic interests are safeguarded in this way.

AI is aimed to connect and upgrade the entire Chinese industry by 2025. Artificial Intelligence will produce goods and control companies, while balancing supply and demand.

Central strategy - local implementation

China is pursuing a centrally controlled strategy with hyperlocal implementation. Values and goals are set from above, and resources are made available.

At the local level of municipalities, cities and provinces, regional administrations compete for the new AI clusters.

The result is a national and regional administrative state that works closely with research, investors and industry to build a successful AI ecosystem.

AI as a career engine

Overall, China is doing many things right. The provision of legal frameworks, resources and goals, coupled with local freedom to adapt, is creating a rapidly growing AI industry. At the same time, the state provides incentives for the administration and politicians to assert themselves in the AI industry and to recommend themselves for higher tasks.

To achieve this, the government takes an analytical approach and is aware of its own weaknesses and strengths. Hundreds of new AI professorships have been established, and hundreds of thousands of study places have been created.

China now has a mature and efficient start-up ecosystem on which younger AI companies are building. There is sufficient capital from both the state and private sector for the establishment, scaling and growth of AI start-ups in China.

The state demands and promotes

Young companies also receive tax breaks, government contracts and offices in AI clusters if they wish.

In parallel, China's government is working closely with established digital companies such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. The strategic orientations are accompanied by the central government, the collection and exchange of data within the companies is made possible.

As a result, China has the largest capital market for AI start-ups, now publishes the most research papers on AI, has generous data regulation and trains the most AI talent.

Artificial Intelligence wars are coming

China will become the first global AI superpower in the foreseeable future.

The USA has already put some Chinese AI companies on sanctions lists. At the same time the export of American AI software to China has been restricted.

But many smaller countries are now dependent on Chinese capital or have an unregulated digital single market. China will expand its influence along the digital Silk Road with the help of capital and AI software.

The battle for control of the strongest Artificial Intelligence will accelerate. China has a head start in this respect, which will be further expanded."
